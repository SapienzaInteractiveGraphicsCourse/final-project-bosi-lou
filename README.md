How to win 
--------------
The key is into at right side of character start position, then move straight on and turn right and go on to open that chest to get the key

Issues
---------------
Load twice for a problem when getting character.getObjectById(121) to load better the character assets. this problem is created by the model that not permit me to get the ribbon using the function character.getObjectByName.

Don't change windows when keep pressed arrow up on the keyboard. not managed this cases.
